A custom shell implementation that mimics the behavior of Unix-like shells. 
This project focuses primarily on parsing and handling special characters and other input scenarios, including quoting, escaped characters, and custom executable names.

To run the project:
1. Ensure you have Java (jdk 23) and Maven (mvn) installed on your system.
1. Run `./your_program.sh` from a Bash-like shell (ex. Git Bash).
